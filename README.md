# Zafe

**A Safe-style multisig for shielded Zcash.** A group of members jointly controls one
shielded address; any member can see the balance, propose a payment and approve it, and
a payment goes out only when **t of the N** members sign.

Zcash's shielded pools have no scripts or contracts, so Zafe uses **re-randomized FROST
threshold signatures**: members' phones jointly produce one ordinary spend signature. On
chain, a Zafe vault looks exactly like a single-user wallet: no owners, no threshold,
nothing that says "multisig".

> **Status: pre-release, testnet/regtest only.** Do not use with real funds. The mainnet
> gate is an upstream confirmation about the key derivation (see
> [`upstream-asks.md`](upstream-asks.md), Q1). Wire formats are not versioned yet.

## How it works

- **Vault keys**: all members run a FROST DKG on their phones, confirm a safety number
  out of band, and sign the vault descriptor. Keys follow ZIP 2005 (quantum-recoverable
  derivation) for the Ironwood pool (NU6.3).
- **No blind signing**: before approving and again before signing, every member's app
  rebuilds and checks the transaction itself: recipients, amounts, memos, change, fee
  and sighash.
- **One-tap approvals**: members pre-publish FROST nonce commitments, so an approval
  already carries the signature share. The member whose approval completes the threshold
  can send automatically; anyone can send once enough shares are in.
- **Blind relay**: a small server forwards signed, HPKE-encrypted envelopes between
  members and sends content-free push notifications. It never sees keys, viewing keys,
  amounts or addresses, and can't spend.
- **Backups**: each member can export an encrypted backup of their key share
  (Argon2id + XChaCha20-Poly1305). Signing nonces are never included.

The full design is in [`spec.md`](spec.md).

## Build and test

Rust (stable, see `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`):

```bash
cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
cargo test --workspace

# ZIP 2005 key-derivation vectors, checked independently in Python
python3 scripts/check_zip2005_vectors.py

# Live regtest (Docker): an in-process end-to-end spend
cargo test -p zafe-core --test regtest_e2e -- --ignored --nocapture
# Three separate `zafe` CLI members through the relay on regtest
scripts/m0-e2e.sh
```

App (Flutter 3.41.6):

```bash
cd app
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build apk --debug --target-platform android-arm64
```

`scripts/app-harness.sh` runs a local relay, regtest and two CLI members so a single phone
or emulator can go through vault creation, payments and approvals. Network endpoints are
build-time `--dart-define`s (`ZAFE_NETWORK`, relay and lightwalletd URLs; defaults point
at a local regtest).
